# Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Estimate_pi

This program estimates pi by considering a unit circle enclosed in a square.
In order to estimate pi, the hit and miss method was employed, we consider
a 2 x 2 square piece of paper with an inscribed circle of radius 1, we then simulate throwing
darts at the sqaure and we have the following relations:
    
    (number of dots inside circle)/(total number of dots) = (area of circle)/(area of square)

# Pattern_Recognition_With_Strings
This program takes a user input pattern and user input word and returns a message on whether the two entries match.\

## Simplematch
Simplematch.py \
identifies the patterns by placing question marks as placeholders. \
> Examples: \
  Pattern: py??on, word: python -> It's a match \
  Pattern: da?, word: bay -> They don't match


Advancedmatch.py is a modification to simplematch, allows "*" to be a placeholder for multiple charcters (code incomplete)
